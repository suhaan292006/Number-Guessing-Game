# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

This is my first C programming project.  
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.  
After each guess, the program gives hints:
- "go higher" if your guess is too low  
- "go lower" if your guess is too high  

The game continues until you guess the correct number, and it shows how many attempts you made.

## What I Learned
- Random number generation with `rand()` and `srand()`
- Using `do-while` loops
- Taking user input with `scanf`
- Tracking the number of guesses
